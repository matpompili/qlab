# qlab

qlab is a Python package that provides methods useful to the Quantum Information Lab @ La Sapienza.

It was developed to conduct the experiments of my MSc thesis.

This is __not__ an official package from the group.

It currently features:
  - A method to evaluate the permanent of a numpy matrix using Ryser's formula.
  This is a fork of Pete Shadbolt's [repository](https://github.com/peteshadbolt/permanent), updated to work with Python 3.6.
  - A controller for the Leoni FiberSwitchÂ© series.
  - A controller for the Keithley 2231A DC Power Supplies.
  - An updated version of Michael Leung's [PyAPT](https://github.com/mcleung/PyAPT), that works with Python 3.6.
  - A controller for the ID Quantique ID800 TDC.
  - An helper function to plot and fit Hong-Ou-Mandel experiments.
